How to choose a config:

the config is similar to HA 1 for example:


#X 8 # the total x axis node
#Y 12 # the total y axis node
#P 2 0 0  D 3 0 13 # the package location and delivery and tim of apearance and time of delivery
#S 0 0 # the starting player nodes
#S 6 0


note that the game mode is configured by the flag for the agents you must have a coralation between the two agents.
for Zero sum game: Z
for semi co-op: S
for Full co-op: W

note the you cannot make a config with two different flags!

how to config:

in the config.txt file in the support files folder you can config any game set you like according to the instructions above.
note that big examples will have a very long timeout.
there is a defaults cutoff of 13 (meaning the biggest depth of the tree is 13) you can change it by going to consts_and_enums folder to game_tree_consts
and change the MAX_DEPTH_CUTOFF value to the value that suits you best.

how to run:

just go to main and press run.

the logger will log the game status to the std out and at the end of each run it will create a log file that recorded the entire simulation
in the support_files/logging_directory

different results:

we have made a sample of configurations for you to see the differences of the modes in the support_files/different_resaults_config.txt file.
you can see and check them for yourself
